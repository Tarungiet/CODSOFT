## Movies Box Office Prediction
### Description
This project aims to predict the box office revenue of movies based on various features such as budget, cast, crew, and other related factors. The dataset used includes extensive information about movies and their performance metrics.

### Methodology
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data to identify patterns and correlations.
- **Model Selection**: Implementing various machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
- **Model Evaluation**: Using metrics such as R-squared and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to evaluate model performance.

### Results
The Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy with an R-squared value of 0.75, indicating a strong predictive power for the box office revenues based on the provided features.

## TV Sales Analysis and Forecasting
### Description
This project analyzes historical sales data of televisions to forecast future sales. The dataset comprises sales figures over several years, including various features like date, sales volume, and promotional activities.

### Methodology
- **Data Cleaning**: Addressing missing values and anomalies.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Decomposing the time series data to understand trends, seasonality, and residuals.
- **Forecasting Models**: Implementing models such as ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM for time series forecasting.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing models based on RMSE and MAE to determine the best performing model.

### Results
The Prophet model provided the most accurate forecasts, with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 50 units, making it a reliable tool for predicting future TV sales.

## Titanic Survival Prediction
### Description
This project focuses on predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic using the famous Titanic dataset. It includes features such as passenger class, sex, age, and fare.

### Methodology
- **Data Cleaning**: Managing missing values, especially in the 'Age' and 'Cabin' columns, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing survival rates across different passenger classes, ages, and sexes.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features like family size and age bins.
- **Model Selection**: Using classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
- **Model Evaluation**: Utilizing accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.

### Results
The Random Forest model achieved an accuracy of 89%, demonstrating strong predictive capability in distinguishing between survivors and non-survivors.
